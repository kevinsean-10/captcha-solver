This is a Captcha Solver by Kevin Sean Hans Lopulalan, implemented using Python Selenium and the Buster extension.

The main file, `captcha_solver.ipynb`, is a Jupyter notebook with comments. This web scraping is performed with the following specifications:
- Firefox 129.0.2
- Python 3.12.3
- Selenium 4.23.1
- Numpy 1.26.4
using Buster 3.1.0 as an extension to solve Recaptcha V2.

The core of this code is how to use Buster to solve captchas, enabling Buster to complete the captcha challenges.
